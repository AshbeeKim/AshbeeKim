### Tips for easy access to Google Colab
1. The markdown code to insert into the README.md files is:  
  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](input your colab url)
2. Click "File"(in Colab) -> "Save a copy in Github" or "Save a copy as a Github Gist"
  * If you save to specific path in Organizations, "Save a copy as a Github Gist" -> type "Organizations path(like SD-academy/AshbeeKim)"(before type the path make sure that you already create this path) -> type "file path(whatever you want)"
  * If you can want to create or save some directory, type "\" in "file path" for distinguishing "directory paths" and "file name.extension"
